- Dementia is not a natural part of ageing
- Dementia is caused by diseases of the brain
- It's not just about losing your memory
- People can still live well with dementia -> suggested treatments:
    - cognitive stimulation, which might involve doing word puzzles or discussing current affairs
    - life story work, sharing memories and experiences with a carer or nurse to create a ‘life story book’
    - keeping as active as possible – physically, mentally and socially – which can boost memory and self esteem, and help avoid depression.
- Alzheimer's Society is here for anyone affected by dementia
